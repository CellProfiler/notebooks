Welcome to the CellProfiler Jupyter notebooks!

Click an `.ipynb` file to browse it statically.

To run a notebook locally, install [Conda](https://conda.io/) and then run:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
source activate cellprofiler-notebooks
jupyter notebook
```

Your browser will open a localhost URL, and you can play around!
